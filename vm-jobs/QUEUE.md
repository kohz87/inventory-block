# VM queue (the lead keeps this current; the VM reads it when the USER asks it to check — the hourly poll is off)

Rules: reviews before writing. Use whichever Codex account has quota (README "Codex accounts"). A job listed as WAITING
has no file yet or isn't ready; skip it. Report each finished job as `VM JOB NNN:` and add it to DONE.

Accounts: A ran out again at 02:11 UTC → back ≈06:11 UTC (14:11 SGT) by the 4-hour rule. B: still out at 02:18 UTC (the run failed before any work, so this is NOT a new run-out; the 4-hour clock stays at its 23:20 run-out) → B resets at 03:13 UTC (11:13 SGT, stated by USER).
A's FREE RESET ACTIVATED by USER at ≈01:16 UTC: A has a fresh window (DOUBLE 5-hour quota, weekly reset too). Earlier note: A's window (from ≈00:28 UTC) has DOUBLE 5-hour quota (USER's free reset, which also resets A's weekly quota). Order: 053 + 054 + 029 (Reconcile + Resume 4) as three parallel threads, then 043/044 as soon as the lead flips them READY (check QUEUE.md between jobs).
For FUTURE outages with no stated time: available again 4 hours after the moment it ran out (README). The VM updates this line.

Order (run top to bottom):
0a. 064 — Sol review: E6b (track-e/e6b-history f4214f4, read-only). READY — LEAD GO-AHEAD: run on B now, in parallel with 027 Resume 3.
0. 049 — DONE 22:18 UTC (E6a clear; seams changes).
1. 051 — DONE 22:19 UTC (HOLD → E5 round 10).
1b. 052 — DONE 22:48 UTC (NOT READY → E5 round 11).
1c. 053 — DONE 01:22 UTC (re-run; HOLDS → E5 MERGED 8015fde).
1d. 054 — DONE 00:34 UTC (HOLD → 055).
1e. 055 — DONE 00:57 UTC (seams 2fbe8d0). ACK: /tmp/s197work and /tmp/s197-publish can be deleted.
1f. 056 — DONE 01:08 UTC (HOLDS: seams clear).
2. 027 — track A. RESUME 3 READY (track B is on RB main febdef5) — LEAD GO-AHEAD: run on B now in parallel with 064 (027-track-a.md "Resume 3", 027-resume3.txt).
3. 029 — DONE 00:59 UTC (Resume 4: T6 815884e, T7 ba94b4c; PR Story_studio#4 opened by the lead). ACK: /tmp/s2work, /tmp/studio-2-git can be deleted; keep the wip-9dbcc03 patch.
3b. 057 — DONE 01:08 UTC (5 blockers → 058).
3c. 058 — DONE 01:23 UTC (studio-2 bf12771). ACK: /tmp/s2fix can be deleted.
3d. 059 — DONE 01:34 UTC (2 blockers → 060).
3e. 060 — DONE 01:49 UTC (studio-2 d40d51e). ACK: /tmp/s2fix2 and /tmp/studio-submit can be deleted.
3f. 061 — DONE 01:58 UTC (B1/B2 hold; 1 blocker → 062).
3g. 062 — DONE 02:08 UTC (studio-2 1de349d) → Story_studio#4 MERGED (85a4140). ACK: /tmp/s2fix3 and the other Studio work folders can be deleted; the package-lock.json deletion in the old checkout can be discarded.
4. 043 — DONE ≈03:50 UTC (E6b parts 1–6, head f4214f4) → review 064.
5. 044 — Resume 1 DONE ≈03:50 UTC (B6 head ccce0b0). RESUME 2 READY (merge main, re-vendor, replay audit, real-module test) — after 064 and 027 Resume 3, on B if room else A.

Done: 048 (20:17 UTC), 046 (19:32 UTC), 047 (19:41 UTC), 036, 037, 038, 039, 040 (E1 MERGED), 041, 045.
